# OBSOLETE

This plugin is obsolete, please refer to https://github.com/chrisbra/Colorizer.

# OLD README:

This is a (quite old) fork, based on [hexHighlight.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2937).

This plugin looks for hex codes of the format #ffffff or #fff and toggles a highlight in that color.
It is useful for editing colorschemes, and generally any config file dealing with colors.

When looking for a Vim color highlighting plugin, I recommend https://github.com/chrisbra/Colorizer instead.

This plugin has the unique feature to handle `highlight` definitions in a Vim syntax file though, but that might get merged some day.
